<h2>The Gift of Dhamma Excels All Gifts</h2>
<p>The following quote by L.B. Horner is particularly apt:
<quote>we of Today, in view of this wonderful gift of Dhamma that has been vouchsafed to us, cannot be merely recipients. We must be givers too. We have had lofty privilege of coming to know something of the Teaching of the Buddha. We live in a Buddha-era. That is at a time when the teachings of a Buddha are still remembered and are of significance. This alone would make it incumbent on us to spread this Teaching of Peace, inner and outer, as far and wide and faithfully as we can. </quote></p>

	Notes
	<li>The Thai provincial govermnent in Chiangmai and federal government in Bangkok hands out awards for deserving meditation teachers who are benefactors of the Buddhist religion. Certain costs are incurred once per year by the meditation center to sponsor awards being received by its teachers, assistants and other nominees.</li>
	<li>The co-directors live full time at the meditation center without remuneration except for donations. Therefore, the center provides regular amounts to the directors to cover their living costs.</li>
	<li>A critical feature of the center is its affliation with the Chomtong Temple and Monastery. In order to ensure the conntinued integration with the Temple and to support the development of accomplished and promosing monastics, the meditation center provides regular financial support for monks and nuns.</li>
	<li>The meditation center is continuing to expand to meet growing demand for insight meditation instruction.</li>
