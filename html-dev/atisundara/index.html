<h2>The Gift of Dhamma Excels All Gifts</h2>
<p>The following quote by L.B. Horner provides a readily accessible answer:
<quote>We of Today, in view of this wonderful gift of Dhamma that has been vouchsafed to us, cannot be merely recipients. We must be givers too. We have had lofty privilege of coming to know something of the Teaching of the Buddha. We live in a Buddha-era. That is at a time when the teachings of a Buddha are still remembered and are of significance. This alone would make it incumbent on us to spread this Teaching of Peace, inner and outer, as far and wide and faithfully as we can. </quote></p>
