<h2>Make the Most of Your Weekend</h2>
<p>If you find your mind is constantly preoccupied with worries, doubts, fears and regrets, you can discover peace by learning to practice a special form of meditation called Vipassana, the Buddha's most beautiful gift to the world.</p>

<h2>What is Vipassana?</h2>
<p>Our teacher, meditation master Ajahn Tong Sirimangalo describes the meaning of Vipassana in his book, The Only Way, as translated by Kathryn Chindporn. He explains as follows:</p>

<div class="home-intro">
<p>Vipassana is a Pali word which means: Seeing clearly, seeing specially or seeing through (Vi - clearly, specially, into, through + passana - seeing). Vipassana means introspection, intuitive wisdom, intuitive knowledge. Vipassana is often translated as insight.</p>

<p>Seeing what clearly? Insight into what?</p>

<p>Vipassana means seeing through the true nature of reality or Insight into the true nature of reality. It means seeing things as they truly are.</p>

<p>Vipassana is the direct and intuitive understanding of the true nature of all mental and physical phenomena.</p>

<p>Vipassana is based on the Four Satipatthana, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. That is to say, Insight is realized by the consistent and progressive application of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.</p>

<p>The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mindfulness of the Body</li>
<li>Mindfulness of Feelings</li>
<li>Mindfulness of the Mind</li>
<li>Mindfulness of the Mind Objects</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Nobility of Silence</h2>
<p>If we are too distracted by the desire to express ourselves through speech, we can never, appreciate the subtly of the present moment through mindfulness. Therefore, at meditation retreats we practice noble silence. This means that during the retreat, there is no talking permitted. The only exception is the talking that you will do with your teacher once or twice a day when you receive the meditation instruction and have an opportunity to ask questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Meals are to be eaten in silence. There is no talking while you eat which frees you of the need to make small talk and helps you to be mindful of eating your food.</li>
<li>Meditation practice is conducted in silence. While you are doing your meditation practice, there is no talking which frees you from the distraction of frivolous speech or gossip and helps you to, instead, observe and learn the true nature of the mind.</li>
<li>Breaks are to be conducted in silence. When you are taking a break from your meditation practice, there is no talking, which helps you to maintain the progress that you achieved from your last round of meditation.</li>
</ol>

<p>This silent study of the mind that you will undertake is noble because it is aimed at achieving real happiness which does not depend on external conditions. When you participate in a silent retreat, you start the process that is necessary to quiet the mind and begin to walk the path of nobility.</p>
