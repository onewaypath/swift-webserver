<p>I am a Certified Public Accountant, a wife, and mother. With these titles, I have grown as a woman and as a professional.</p>
<p> Being a professional is a responsibility that I have to carry on with both my mind and my heart. I believe that serving people and to be able to inspire and touch them through my knowledge, skills, and talents are my purpose in life.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to work on top companies and to be one of its executive officers. I believe that success comes from within, If you have the overwhelming desire to be successful then you will surely acquire it.</p>
<p>When I am not working, I am busy being a mother of two. I can cook a mean meal, create arts and crafts stuff, and I love playing with my kids!</p>
